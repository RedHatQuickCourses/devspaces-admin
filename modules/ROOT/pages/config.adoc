# Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces Configuration
:navtitle: Configuration

Configuration involves controlling multiple aspects Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces around security, resource management, storage management, networking and customizing workspaces tailored to the kinds of applications being developed. 

In this section, we focus on tasks that are typically managed by Dev Spaces administrators and OpenShift administrators:

* Configuring the `CheCluster` Custom Resource
* Configuring the Kubernetes image puller to cache container images and speed up workspace start
* Configuring the `fuse-overlayfs` storage driver for improved performance

Other areas of administration, including storage, advanced workspace configuration, security, and network security related aspects are covered in a dedicated course targeting workspace configuration, at a later stage in the learning path.
