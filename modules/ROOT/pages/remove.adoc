:navtitle: Uninstall

== Uninstallation using dsc CLI

You can clean up all operator provisioned resources using a single `dsc` CLI command with the `--delete-all` and `--delete-namespace` flag with the namespace where you installed Dev Spaces:

```bash
$ dsc server:delete --delete-all --delete-namespace -n openshift-devspaces

== Uninstallation using OpenShift Web Console

Do the following as a cluster administrator user (`admin`) to uninstall Dev Spaces using the OpenShift web console.

. Delete Dev Spaces workspaces, if you have launched any after installation. Dev Spaces related namespaces are of the format `<user>-devspaces`. For example, **user1-devspaces**.

----
$ oc delete namespace user1-devspaces

. In the OpenShift web console, navigate to `Operators > Installed Operators > Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance Specification`, and then click on the `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance Specification` tab.

. Expand the menu (three vertical dots) next to the `devspaces` instance, and then click `Delete CheCluster` to delete the instance. You will be asked to confirm the deletion of the instance. Click `Delete`.

. Navigate to `Operators > Installed Operators` in the OpenShift web console and uninstall the `DevWorkspace Operator` in a similar fashion.

. Optionally, use the `oc` CLI to delete the `openshift-devspaces` namespace as a cluster administrator user to clean up any resources that were not removed during the uninstallation process.

WARNING: Installing Dev Spaces also installs the `DevWorkspace` operator, which creates a few global resources (for example, webhook resources) that need to be cleaned up manually. See the link in the *References* section to completely remove the `DevWorkspace` operator. Failure to remove these global resources will result in future installations failing. To fully clean all the resources provisioned by the installation, use the `dsc --delete-all ` command outlined in the previous sub-section.
