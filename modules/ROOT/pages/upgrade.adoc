= Upgrading Dev Spaces
:navtitle: Upgrade

The Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces Operator supports two upgrade strategies:

* Automatic - The Operator __automatically__ installs new updates when they become available.
* Manual - New updates need to be __manually__ approved before installation begins.

If you chose the `Manual` approval mode, then the OpenShift web console indicates that an upgrade is available in the `Operators > Installed Operators` page.

Click `Upgrade Available` for the Dev Spaces operator, and then click `Preview InstallPlan` to review the upgrade. You will see a list of resources that are available for upgrade. Click `Approve` to proceed with the upgrade.

You can also upgrade Dev Spaces using the `dsc` client:

```bash
$ dsc server:update -n openshift-devspaces
```

NOTE: Run `dsc server:update --help` command to view the list of options. If you get timeout errors during the upgrade process, add the `--k8spodwaittimeout=1800000` flag to increase timeout values.  Run `dsc server:deploy --help` to see the flags for other timeout settings.
