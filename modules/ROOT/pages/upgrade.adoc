= Upgrading Dev Spaces
:navtitle: Upgrade

Upgrading Dev Spaces depends on the approval mode you selected during the operator installation. If you selected `Automatic` mode, then you do not need any human intervention to upgrade. Whenever newer versions of the operator are available, they are fetched _automatically_ and upgraded.

If you chose the `Manual` approval mode, then the OpenShift web console indicates that an upgrade is available in the `Operators > Installed Operators` page.

Click `Upgrade Available` for the Dev Spaces operator, and then click `Preview InstallPlan` to review the upgrade. You will see a list of resources that are available for upgrade. Click `Approve` to proceed with the upgrade.
