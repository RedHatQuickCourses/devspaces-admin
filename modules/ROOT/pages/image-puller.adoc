# Configuring the Kubernetes Image Puller
:navtitle: Image Puller

In the previous lab, you would have noted that it took a long time for the Workspace to start and display the IDE, even if the Workspace was empty (No source code tree). Dev Spaces loads a default container image (called the **Universal Developer Image - UDI**) in a Workspace if you did not specify one explicitly. To reduce the start up time of workspaces, use the **Image Puller**, an OpenShift component that can be used to pre-pull and cache container images.

The Image Puller is an additional OpenShift deployment which creates a `DaemonSet` that can be configured to pre-pull relevant OpenShift Dev Spaces workspace images on each node. These images would already be available when an OpenShift Dev Spaces workspace starts, therefore improving the workspace start up time.

NOTE: Dev Spaces, by default caches container images at the OpenShift node level. For example, if `user1` downloads a 5GB container image, and if his workspace is scheduled on `node1` of an OpenShift cluster, then if `user2` uses the same container image in his workspace, which is also scheduled on `node1`, then `user2` will see faster start up time of his workspace due to caching. However if `user2` workspace is scheduled on `node2`, which does NOT have the container images cached, he will see increased start up time while the 5GB image is downloaded on `node2`. The Kubernetes image puller solves this problem by caching a list of container images on **every** node in the OpenShift cluster.

== Lab: Configure the Kubernetes Image Puller

. Like in previous exercises, you can use `oc` CLI or GitOps approach to configuring the YAML files. You will start by installing the `Kubernetes Image Puller` operator on OpenShift. Prepare the following `Subscription` resource in a file named `image-puller-sub.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml,subs=+quotes]
----
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "2"
  name: kubernetes-imagepuller-operator
  namespace: openshift-devspaces
spec:
  channel: stable
  installPlanApproval: Automatic
  name: kubernetes-imagepuller-operator
  source: community-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
  startingCSV: kubernetes-imagepuller-operator.v1.1.0
----

. Apply the configuration file:
+
[source,bash,subs=+quotes]
----
$ oc apply -f image-puller-sub.yaml
----

. Navigate to the `Operators > Installed Operators` page of the OpenShift web console, select `openshift-devspaces` in the `Project` drop-down, and verify that the Kubernetes Image Puller operator is installed successfully.

. You need a list of container images that you need the image puller to pre-pull before workspace start. Navigate to the following URL and grab the list of container images. You can also add other third party and custom container images to the list.
+
https://<openshift_dev_spaces_fqdn>/plugin-registry/v3/external_images.txt
+
```bash
registry.redhat.io/devspaces/udi-rhel8:3.15
registry.redhat.io/devspaces/idea-rhel8:3.15
registry.redhat.io/devspaces/code-rhel8:3.15
```

. Edit the `devspaces` CheCluster CR YAML configuration and configure the image puller:
+
[source,yaml,subs=+quotes]
----
apiVersion: org.eclipse.che/v2
kind: CheCluster
metadata:
  name: devspaces
  namespace: openshift-devspaces
  annotations:
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options: SkipDryRunOnMissingResource=true
    argocd.argoproj.io/sync-wave: "3"
spec:
  components:
...
    devfileRegistry: {}
    *imagePuller:
      enable: true <1>
      spec:
        images: >- <2>
          registry.redhat.io/devspaces/udi-rhel8:3.15;registry.redhat.io/devspaces/idea-rhel8:3.15;registry.redhat.io/devspaces/code-rhel8:3.15
        ... 
----
+
<1> - Enable the image puller
<2> - List of images to pre-pull on OpenShift nodes separated by semi-colon (";")

. Navigate back to the `Operators > Installed Operators` page in the OpenShift web console. Click `Kubernetes Image Puller` in the `Provided APIs` column. Observe that a new instance of `KubernetesImagePuller` CR, named `devspaces-image-puller` is now active. Click on `devspaces-image-puller` and verify that your list of images is listed in the `Images to pull` field at the bottom of the screen
+

. Try and launch workspaces as different users and notice that apart from the first Workspace launch, subsequent launches should be faster because the container images have been cached.
+
TIP: You can identify which container images are being launched in a Workspace, by clicking on the `Events` tab when you launch a Workspace from the Dev Spaces dashboard.

+
You can also run the following command in the namespace (in the format __<username>-devspaces__) created for the user, to view the container images pulled for the Workspace:
+
**oc get events -n user1-devspaces **
