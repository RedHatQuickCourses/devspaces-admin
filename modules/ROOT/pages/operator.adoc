= Installation Using the OpenShift Web Console
:navtitle: OpenShift Web Console

Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces is available as an operator that can be installed using the OpenShift web console (_OperatorHub_).

== Pre-requisites

* You should have provisioned an OpenShift 4.16+ cluster as outlined the `Classroom Environment` section of the course home page. 
* Download the OpenShift client `oc` for your platform from from the OpenShift web console by clicking the "?" icon on the top right navigation bar. Uncompress the archive file, and then copy the `oc` binary for your platform to the system path (usually `/usr/local/bin` on UNIX systems).
* Cluster administrator access to OpenShift (both CLI and web console). Verify that you can log in to the OpenShift web console and CLI as a cluster administrator.

== Lab: Installing Dev Spaces Using the OpenShift Web Console

. Log in as the `admin` user with cluster-administrator permissions. Create a new OpenShift project named *openshift-devspaces*. You will install the Dev Spaces operator and instance into this project.

WARNING: The OpenShift web console will not allow you to create a new namespace/project starting with `openshift-`. You have to create the namespace using the `oc` CLI.

. Log in to your OpenShift web console as the `admin` user with a password of `openshift23`.

. Click `Operators > OperatorHub` in the left side navigation bar of the `Administrator` perspective in the OpenShift web console.

. Search for `dev spaces` in the search field on this page, and then select the `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces` operator.

. In the operator details page, select the `stable` channel and the latest `Version` of Dev Spaces (3.15 as of Sep 2024), and then click `Install`.

. In the `Install Operator` page, leave all fields at their default value and only change the `Installed Namespace` field to `openshift-devspaces`. Click `Install` to proceed.

. Click `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces instance Specification` in the `Provided APIs` column to create a new Dev Spaces instance from the installed operator. Click `Create CheCluster`.

. In the `Create CheCluster` page, leave all values at defaults, and click `Create` to create a new Dev Spaces instance. You will accept the default configuration at this point and get a basic Dev Spaces instance up and running. You will progressively configure the instance in subsequent courses in the learning path.

. Wait for a few minutes while the instance is created. Click the `devspaces` CheCluster resource and verify that the `Message` field says `None`, indicating that the instance was successfully initialized.

. Click on the `Resources` tab and note the list of Kubernetes resources created. All the resources must have a `Status` of `Created`.

. Switch back to the `Details` tab. Note the link to the Dev Spaces instance under the `Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces URL` field.

.. Log in as the `user1` user with a password of `openshift23`.
.. Click `Allow selected permissions` to allow `user:full` permissions for this user.
