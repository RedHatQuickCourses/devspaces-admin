You need to create the appropriate users in the OpenShift cluster to do the hands-on labs in this learning path.  You will configure HTTPassword based authentication for the OpenShift cluster in this section.

== Configuring OpenShift Users and Authentication

Irrespective of how you provisioned your OpenShift cluster, you need to configure a user account with cluster-administrator access, as well as **five** non-cluster-administrator accounts (to simulate developers using Dev Spaces) for OpenShift. 

. Download and inspect the following two YAML configuration files, which create an `admin` user with cluster-administrator access and five non-admin users (`user1 - user5`). The password for both the `admin` and `user1 - user5` users is `openshift23`.

* https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatQuickCourses/devspaces-apps/main/ocp-auth/secret.yaml

. Log in to the OpenShift cluster as the `kubeadmin` user using the `oc` CLI

----
$ oc login -u kubeadmin _<OpenShift API URL>_
----

. Apply the two configuration files
+
[subs=+quotes]
----
$ oc replace -f *authentication.yaml*
$ oc apply -f *secret.yaml*

+
Log out from the OpenShift web console and CLI. You may have to wait for 5 minutes while the changes take effect. You will see a login prompt with the `htpasswd_provider` displayed.

. On the updated login page, click the `htpasswd_provider` button, and log in as the `admin` user with password `openshift23` to access the OpenShift web console as a cluster administrator. Repeat the process for the `user1` user and verify that you can access the OpenShift web console as a regular non-admin user.
